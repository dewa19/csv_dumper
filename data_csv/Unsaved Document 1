I'm a freelance PHP Backend Developer with several back end projects experiences. 
My works, basically focused on :
1. Create "a bridge" through API end point, in order to be able to get connected with other business point.
2. Build back end processes to facilitate communication between two business points.
3. *anything that have something to do with background process*

At the moment, I'm in the process of learning Elixir, as in my opinion, the concurrency model it brings will make back end system more resilient and robust.

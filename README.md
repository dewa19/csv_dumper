# CsvDumper

 Periodically, download a CSV file, parse its content and insert them into a Redis cache. Then, provide that data for end user through public API.

 This scenario is developed as process of learning Elixir.

 Thanks to SpatialKey for letting me use their CSV sample file (https://support.spatialkey.com/spatialkey-sample-csv-data/).
